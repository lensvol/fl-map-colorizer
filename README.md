Conceptualized and implemented in the first draft by **Zolana**.

Small extension that allows you to see full-coloured map of Fifth City in the map compatibility mode.

Would not be possible without amazing map found in [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fallenlondon/comments/fdhqgy/high_resolution_image_of_new_map/) by [Jasper Ward-Berry](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jasper_Ward-Berry/)!
